a.discard(8)# this also removes the element from set
# difference between remove() and discard() is that if the element is not prsent 
# remove() will rais an error
# discard() will not rais an error
a.pop() # this will remove a random value as set is un-ordered , and it will return the poped value
del a # this will delete the set from the code 
s2.clear() # this will not delete the set from the code but delete the all elements from set
