BANGALORE TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
 
Bangalore, one of India’s fastest-growing metropolitan cities, experiences severe traffic congestion, with over 10 million daily travellers. 
The city’s traffic issues start from poor traffic management, unplanned roadside construction, limited road capacity, and ineffective time-based traffic control. 
These challenges result in increased travel time, frequent accidents, high pollution levels, and even delays for emergency services such as ambulances.

To address these issues, we aim to analyze traffic patterns in some of the busiest areas of Bangalore using real-world traffic data collected over several days.
The goal is to identify key problem zones, peak congestion times, and root causes, ultimately suggesting data-driven solutions for better traffic planning and management.
