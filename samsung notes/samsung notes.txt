PYTHON

operators in python :

-arthematic operators:
	+, -, *, /, //,**,%
	all the arthematic operations are binary operations
	inpython operations are done from left to right
	while performing operations presidence comes to play rather than left to right
	** has the heighest presidence
	* / // % has next presidence
	+ - has the lowest presidence
	example:
		2 + 3 * 2 ** 2
		2 + 3 * 4
		2 + 12
		14
	2.5 + 5
	here we cannot perform the operation until we convert 5 to decimal

format specifier
%d for integer
%nd means use n spaces to print the integer
ex :
	a = 23
	print("%5d"%a)
	output:
   >   23
    -----  total 5 spaces used for printing integer a

similar for float 
%f is the format specifier for float 
%nf means print only n decimals of the float
ex:
	a = 1.234453
	print("%2f"%a)
	output:
   >1.23
for spaces used in float we use
%n.f means n spaces for printing the float value 

FOR LOOP:
for i in range(1,10):
	print(i,end=" ")
	output:
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
range() is a function in python which takes a range

arry/list
 
*A list in Python is a collection of ordered, mutable elements. It can hold elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, objects, or even other lists.
*indexable - Access elements using index positions (list[0], list[1], etc.)
*Heterogeneous - Can store items of different data types (int, str, float, list, etc.)
*Iterable - Can be used in loops (like for item in list)
*Dynamic size - Size can grow or shrink automatically
*Allows duplicates - Can contain duplicate values

1 - find the smallest and biggest value in the list of n numbers

2 - find the freequency of an element in a list of n elements

3 - remove the duplicates from the list of n elaments

** 4 -  given a  number find very next possible biggest number that has all the digits of the given number

** 5 - Kaprekar's Constant problem
find the count of recursion required to reach Kaprekar's Constant 

	1982
	step 1 stor the digits in decreasing order 
	step 2 sort in increasing order
	step 3 difference 2 from 1
	step 4 keep on repeating the steps 1 2 3on the number got on the step 3

recursive problems:
1 - factorial of a numbers
2 - fibonacci numbers till the number
3 - sum of elements in the list

**
exception is a runtime error
so insted of letting the interpretor to handel the exception which stops the execution we should the exceptionss ourselves
this is done by try except block
we use this because we suspect that something may go wrong while execution of the following block

if there are multiple lines in the try block 
but the lines below the error line will be not considered

but when you except an error the default except must be at the last
like-> except:
			print()
	this one should be at the last except because the specalized errors that we use with name comes first
	
correct form:
try :
	pass
except exception :
	pass
except zerodivisionerror:
	pass
except:  <-- this should be at the last
	pass

inheritence is the procces of adding new featurs or the adding new solution to the existing problem 
it basically is inheriting properties from parent to childrens along with childrens own properties

polymorphism allows the same function, method, or operator to behave differently based on the context or data type
